# Horse memory game

This is a memory game written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

 
## UX
 

This is a memory game with 20 horse images (10 breeds) for any one that feels a memory game is the game to play (maybe you're interested in horses too).
A sound of horse neigh is played when each card are flipped, a sound of applause is played when two cards are matched,
and a sound of fanfare is played when the game is completed.
Decision was made to have a no border around the cards. The color scheme green suits the nature in which horses lives.

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

- 

The wireframe is included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory called wireframe).

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...
- Game-board: consists of 20 cards with 10 different horse breeds

- Score-bar: The player gain 10 scores when two cards are matched but loses 5 scores if it's a wrong match.

- "New game" button: Creates a new game

### Features Left to Implement
- Add breed names on each card to learn the breeds

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript - The project uses JavaScript for interactivity and for the gameboard to flip the cards

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
